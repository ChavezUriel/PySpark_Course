When we have a two column table, we call it key/value RDD's
We can have lists as values as well

## some usefull functions to deal with this kind of RDD's

reduceByKey()
if we want to agreggate all the values having the sabe key we can use this function
it recieves a funciton than indicates how to aggregate
example: rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x,y: x+y)

groupByKey()
Groups by key and get a list of values having the same key

sortByKey()
Sort RDD by key values

key(), values()
creates an RDD of just keys or just values


## SQL like joins
we can perform sql like joins with these funciotns
join, rightOuterJoin, leftOuterJoin, cogroup, subtractByKey


## only on values functions
we can use mapValues() or flatMapValues() to transform rdds and dont affect keys 
this is more efficient than using standard functions and ignoring the key
